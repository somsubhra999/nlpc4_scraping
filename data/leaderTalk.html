                                            Welcome, AIM associates, to our first ever AIM Chronicles! You might be wondering,
                                            “So what are these Chronicles anyway?” The AIM Chronicles are an invitation for
                                            you to get to know your leaders better. Coming into 2016 we blogged about changing
                                            our Business Unit’s name to Analytics and Information Management, AIM (spoken as
                                            the word “aim” and not initials). We also committed to sharing with you the organizational
                                            changes that would come along with that, however, we didn’t think you’d appreciate
                                            a long e-mail with a lot of pictures and facts about your leaders that you can easily
                                            look up on LinkedIn. So…we envisioned something totally radical. A leadership experience
                                            that tells you virtually nothing about their credentials to be leaders and as much
                                            as possible about who they are as people.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            Through answering seven simple questions, and posting short videos, our hope is
                                            that you not only get to know, but get inspired by your leaders. You may also have
                                            some questions about some of the new titles that you are seeing in the Chronicles
                                            so we wanted to take a brief moment to clarify that as well:<br>
                                            <br>
                                        </p>
                                        <ul class="welcome-text-list ">
                                            <li>TSG – Technology Solutions Group – This is the part of our business that will largely
                                                focus on everything that the erstwhile EIM was great at!</li>
                                            <li>BSG – Business Solutions Group – This is where you will find our core/advanced analytics
                                                team. However, it is the responsibility of all AIM associates to learn analytics
                                                regardless of if you are a part of TSG or BSG.</li>
                                            <li>AIM Head – By region, these are the overall leaders for the respective AIM verticals.
                                                Within each AIM vertical there will be a distinct TSG and BSG Group leader that
                                                rolls into the AIM Overall Head.</li>
                                            <li>H2 – Horizon 2, and in the context of the Chronicles you will likely see this used
                                                to identify a number of our service lines within AIM including EDM, EIA and EPM
                                                just to name a few.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        <br>
                                        <p>
                                            With that, we truly hope you enjoy the AIM Chronicles and do look forward to hearing
                                            your feedback! Please feel free to drop a note to Radha and I to let us know what
                                            you think. We also hope that the Chronicles inspire you to reach out to your leaders
                                            and to introduce yourself! All the best and enjoy!</p>

                                            Once upon a time in a land called AIM<br />
                                            Our leaders envisioned a business with a new name<br />
                                            Newly Analytics and Information Management but the passion would remain<br />
                                            As we lead with Analytics and in the market change the game!<br />
                                            <br />
                                            The new name, however, is just the title page<br />
                                            The true content comes alive as our leaders engage<br />
                                            Rather than a traditional org announcement from the old age<br />
                                            In the AIM Chronicles you will see our leaders come alive onstage!<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Every leader you click on will be like an invitation<br />
                                            To an exclusive stop at their personal station<br />
                                            Through their writing and videos we hope you gain confirmation<br />
                                            That these are leaders you can look up to for inspiration<br />
                                            <br />
                                            So kick back, relax and read on dear AIMers
                                            <br />
                                            At a minimum, we’ve asked our leaders to be entertainers!
                                            <br />
                                            To get us started I invite you to watch this video of me
                                            <br />

                                            Hey everyone! Hope everybody had a great beginning to the year. I am super excited
                                            you know. Thanks to all of your efforts, we finished 2015 on a fantastic note. We
                                            won the best horizontal award, thanks to all of your efforts and passion and I couldn’t
                                            thank you guys enough.
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            2016 is in front of us, the next 5 years is going to be quite a journey for us as
                                            we double down on our 2020 strategy and continue to drive leadership in this new
                                            era given by data and analytics. Towards that, one of the thing we decided to do
                                            this year was, as many of you were aware, we felt the need for us to actually bring
                                            together our Analytics and Information Management practices into one single organization.
                                            And we did that keeping in mind, not just what our clients want today, but what
                                            our clients would need tomorrow and this also gives you the opportunity to build
                                            the career that would be a truly integrated data, information management, analytics
                                            career. We want to lead the market with analytics, we want to lead the market to
                                            a consultative approach and we really want our clients to be able to recognize the
                                            fact that we are not just order takers but we are actually solution shapers and
                                            we are their strategic advisers.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            This year keeping in tone the fact that Analytics and sort of the directional notion<br /><br /><br />
                                            here is for us to drive more empathy, drive the human quotient in what we do, we
                                            decided to do our leadership announcements this year a little differently.I am sure
                                            that you guys are used to these big emails we tend to send out every year with a
                                            whole bunch of names in it and a real mish mash of who is where. I would be the
                                            first to apologize on behalf of everybody that’s done that before.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            This year we have decided to build what we call our AIM Chronicles and as part of
                                            The AIM Chronicles what we wanted to do is really give you a good view into the
                                            leadership that we have in this business unit and get to know them not just as people
                                            that execute their responsibilities as your leaders, but as fellow human beings.
                                            What excites them, what gets them going and really get to know them that way, and
                                            in the process what I am hoping would happen is that you just don’t get to know
                                            them, but also reach out to them, connect with them and help us build our AIM family
                                            together. Thats really what I wanted to say. Once again wishing you guys a phenomenal
                                            2016 and in the tone of what we are doing over here, or at least what we are trying
                                            to do over here, I hope we achieve par plus results and really knock the ball out
                                            of the park.

                                            Hello everyone, I am Kavitha Lokesh, Assistant Vice President and I currently head
                                            the Global Business Development Team for AIM Practice.
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            Quick intro about myself, I bring overall 20 years of IT experience and I am celebrating
                                            my sweet 16 with Cognizant this year. I spent over 14 years with Life Sciences vertical
                                            and last two years I’ve been part of young and energetic AIM team.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            On the personal front, I come from Coimbatore, a small town in South India and I
                                            am an Engineering graduate from GCT Coimbatore. I’ve been blessed with great parents
                                            and a lovable husband, who play a great part in my success and I’m mom of two lovely
                                            daughters and I really love reading books and cooking, as well as watching television
                                            and movies.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            So what really excites me is whenever I go and meet my customers, or whatever we
                                            discuss about new solutions or services, I see that everything revolves around Data
                                            and Analytics and I see this as a great opportunity and a great future for all of
                                            us in Analytics and Information Management practice. Also as we embark on the 2020
                                            vision of being a 5 billion dollar Practice, I really look forward to innovate and
                                            transform and also make this entire journey, next 5 years journey, a really a fun
                                            filled and a learning experience for me as well as for all of you. Thank you.

                                            with strategically as well. Little bit about me, I live in gloomy Seattle and I
                                            have a passion for endurance sports. I run at least a couple of half marathons every
                                            year and I have bunch of other things like triathlon as well as long bike ride in
                                            my list. This year I am planning Seattle to Portland – 210 miles bike ride. So wish
                                            me luck, thank you. Bye.

                                            that we have a lot of good days together and we have lot of fun and we are very
                                            successful. Thanks again and great meeting you all and look forward to working with

                                        as I can remember. I have been with the many avatars of data and analytics space
                                        over the last 16 years. I tried my hand at mainstream academics for a couple of
                                        years in between and I loved every minute of it. I have a variety of interests –
                                        reading, cooking, running, trekking, teaching, music, yoga to name a few – world

                                                            Run would be right up there as my favorite English movies. Sholay and Jaane Bhi
                                                            Do Yaaron are the Hindi movies that I can watch over and over. I also love watching

                                        <p class="chapter-text">
                                            Hi, a quick introduction about myself. I’m Ranjith Nair. I am part of the AIM Comm
                                            team here in North America. I’ve been with Cognizant for over 12 years now and I’m
                                            based out of Dallas, Texas.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            So let me begin by congratulating you, if you have made it this far, you have passed
                                            all our rigorous screening process and all those interviews. It means that you are
                                            very good at your job.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            So what else do you really need to understand about the expectations and the culture
                                            here in AIM. Right off the bat I would say, we expect everybody to bring whole lot
                                            of personal and professional integrity to the job, whether its in your dealings
                                            with your associates, your partners or your, most importantly your clients. Secondly
                                            100% or more commitment if possible. We wouldn’t have come this far or grown this
                                            fast, if it weren’t for the extreme level of commitment exhibited by our 200 thousand
                                            people on a daily basis.
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            We expect all our folks to be hands on and detail oriented and be aware of all the
                                            nuances of your job. That’s all. Be in complete control of what you do.
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            Fourthly I would say personal accountability and ownership is important. And that
                                            goes without saying, sometimes things don’t go as planned and the first thing we
                                            expect all our folks to do, if that happens, is to acknowledge the fact and then
                                            go ahead and solve the problem. Right, if ever you are in a situation like that,
                                            you will find that there is always a great deal of help available to you.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Lastly I would say you know, invest in yourself and your team. So what you do today
                                            is obviously not what you will be doing in a couple of years time. The technologies
                                            change, market situation changes, expectations from our clients keep changing and
                                            you have to make sure that you take ownership of your future and invest in yourself
                                            and your team.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            And while you’re working with us, you know, please don’t neglect, you know, your
                                            personal life, your family. They’re the ones that help you succeed and we want you
                                            to have a long stint with us. So good luck and hope to meet you soon.

                                            Hi everybody, David Larson with Business Solutions Group in AIM. Working in an area
                                            affectionately called CIMET which is Communications Information Media Entertainment
                                            and Technology. Working on one of my old truck right here. Get ready to do little
                                            over lining and set them to Rockies. It is a beautiful day and probably going to
                                            be close to 70 degrees today. Grab the mountain bike and head on up there. I don’t
                                            know about you but we work all day with our brains, our computers, dealing with
                                            our clients, sometimes you have to go out and ranch on some, get little grease on
                                            your finger nails, actually build something physical, that’s what I am doing today.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            To talk a little bit about AIM, what a great opportunity. I’ve worked in some really
                                            large companies like IBM and you know this value proposition we are working with
                                            market with is fantastic. For the first time we really can take a client from strategy
                                            in our consulting group to the ability that information engineered, data at the
                                            source, convert it, score it through Analytics, bring out the visualization and
                                            then be able to put that in the hands of decision makers, so they can go get actual
                                            insights and make decisions about it and run the business different. Cant do that
                                            everywhere.<br />
                                            <br /><br />
                                            <br />
                                            For associates, great opportunity for you guys. You guys for the first time are
                                            having much larger Organization to be part of and think about it. Its dealing with
                                            all the things that are hot in the market place Internet of things, digital, all
                                            these different things plus your career paths. You can now take a strategy consulting
                                            type of career path, Analytics, Technical, and that really makes an improvement
                                            in the work and the value of your personal brand and how we bring it to the market
                                            place and the value of our clients. So I think this new value proposition works.
                                            I am excited to have you on our team. Looking forward to working together more.
                                            Speaking of working. See if I got this thing working for the first time. Truck started
                                            and I am going to go for a ride. See you soon. Bye.

                                            Some of you may recognize me from playing bass guitar in the concert for Chennai
                                            back in December when we raised money for the recovery. Actually it is an interesting
                                            story, I was playing bass guitar in that band but the first time I held a real guitar,
                                            having learnt how to play piano and things like that as a child was when I was 12
                                            years old. And when I held it and felt it vibrating against my chest, I fell in
                                            love and I have been playing guitar ever since.

                                            guitar here was made in Providence, Rhode Island about 45 years ago. What I would
                                            like to do is to play sort of classically American rag time tunes, you may have
                                            heard this particular style where it is sort of like a walking piano sound. [plays

                                            Hi friends. My name is Chandra, Chandra Lakshminarayan. I represent the Healthcare
                                            Business Solutions Group within the AIM Organization. Like to welcome you all to
                                            the Practice. Hope you are all doing well. What do I love about AIM. Let me put
                                            this question a little differently. What’s there not to love about AIM.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            I am sure you all heard about our recent win as the best horizontal, within Cognizant
                                            last year and I think it just exemplifies what we do as an Organization as a Practice.
                                            This is a practice that is grown consistently year after year and again the basis
                                            of this growth has been people and our love for our customers and the constant drive
                                            to win. I think I love that part. It’s the spirit that carries us forward.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Lets talk about Data and Analytics and even then I focus on Healthcare, I wanted
                                            to bring in a couple of interesting facets to this area. So Data and Analytics obviously
                                            across industries is becoming more and more important. Its relevant we talk about
                                            that. It’s the insights that we can derive across customers, customer behavior,
                                            operations, increasing revenues, improving efficiencies, reducing cost - all that
                                            is critical. But from a Healthcare context, if you think about it, there is a social
                                            side to it. There is a very important aspect of people right, we are dealing with
                                            people, we are focusing on solutions that can improve people’s lives. It can help
                                            people and that’s the very important facet, when there are obviously other characteristics
                                            like customer experience, member experience, what we do to engage better with our
                                            customers but the key aspect I think is around patient outcomes that Healthcare
                                            provides, I think that’s very important for us to remember.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            So that being said, I am very pleased to talk to you. It’s a very exciting part
                                            of our lives. The next 5 years is going to be fairly engrossing and there is lot
                                            of stuff that we are going to do over the next 5 years. My associate id is 435371
                                            to reach out to me with your ideas and solutions and I would be very happy to connect
                                            with you. Thank you and wish you the best. Thanks.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

                                            Hi how is everybody doing? Ohh man, not another Friday were I have been asked to
                                            cook an Indian curry, if you please in 30 minutes. I am going to whip it up in 30
                                            minutes. I have just got the garlic and ginger going in the food processor, I have
                                            got my spices. I have decided to make a tomato based cauliflower - frozen peas,
                                            thats in the fridge, curry which is going to be tomato based and just got the food
                                            processor going.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            I am going to start preparing the onions. Now you may ask me this question, as to
                                            why I am not using the food processor for the onions right. The garlic and ginger
                                            goes well with the food processor because I am able to cut it fine and when I sauté
                                            the garlic and the ginger I get the flavor flowing into the curry. Now when it comes
                                            to the onion, I prefer cutting and chopping. The reason, is if I put it in the food
                                            processor, the food processor makes it mushy and it lets out too much water which
                                            takes a lot of time for me to sauté and get that browning texture and flavor in
                                            to the curry. So I choose to cut the onions and by cutting the onions I have reduced
                                            the time taken to sauté the onions and get it to a brown flavor, I get that brown
                                            deep flavor in to the curry and I am able to deliver a fantastic tasty meal.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Now let’s savvy this friends. How different is that from the decisions we make in
                                            the work place right. We make decisions on how to deliver quality outcomes to our
                                            customer. Many time intuitively that we may feel that a particular process may be
                                            faster and may deliver that outcome for our customer, but just as the decision we
                                            made here, sometimes it requires putting that additional effort right upfront to
                                            ensure that we deliver true outcomes and quality outcomes for our customers. So
                                            this is my ask of all of you. I want us to think about how can we whip up that culture
                                            that is focused on quality and delivery and serve some amazing gourmet meals to
                                            our clients. I am really excited to be here in Cognizant in the Analytics and Information
                                            Management Practice and I believe there is no better place to cook up a phenomenal

                                            Hey Rajat here. Hey how you doing. Well I am doing fabulous. Thank you, Thank you.
                                            Well, Yeah just about had a client visit, so this was a meeting with CIO of Post
                                            Italy, Giri and myself meet. This was a 2 hour workshop, went well. The topic was
                                            order management system that was the primary topic, but towards the later part of
                                            the workshop, for last half an hour or so, we made a pitch for both our platform
                                            BigDecisions as well as the OneRetail solutions. So initially seemed like When we
                                            started talking about, they were not necessarily looking for the BI space but it
                                            really really sparked their interest, we will see how it goes next.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Hey speaking of the BigDecisions platform, can we make sure that all of our team
                                            members know, understand what this is. You know both, not just the platform, but
                                            as well as the some of the solutions that we have. An another thing, that would
                                            I like in addition to our team, is make sure that we are socializing this with our
                                            account managers, full account team - the client partners and the account managers
                                            for all of the accounts we have. I sincerely think that this is really we have a
                                            great opportunity going forward this year in this space. So let’s do everything
                                            we can bring bear to have a great year.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Speaking of the team by the way, let me tell you this, that last four five weeks
                                            I did have the great opportunity to interact with many of them and I could not say
                                            enough good things about the team members. I think we got a really a rock star team.
                                            Please let them know. Hey I need to get going let’s catch up later. Thank you. Bye

                                            Hi Ganesh, How are you? What you do in Cognizant?<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Hey thank you. I am in Cognizant from 2003. I am part of an organization, a group
                                            called Analytics and Information Management. What we do is all about Data Warehousing,
                                            Business Intelligence, Big Data, Advance Analytics lot of stuff. I played various
                                            roles and started with more an Informatica developer and today I manage the Manufacturing
                                            logistics energy utilities as well as the Travel and Hospitality portfolio. In addition
                                            to that, I also have a technology role I am leading the Oracle BI Center of Excellence
                                            in North America. So I closely work with Oracle, customers as well as Oracle to
                                            partner with them and understand their new technologies.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Wow!! That lots of years an experience. What motivates you?<br />
                                            <br />
                                            I think there are few things which you need to align with Cognizant. So two things
                                            I want to refer, I think there are many but two things I want to refer, one is Growth
                                            I am always focused around growth and Cognizant is exactly matching that. So everybody
                                            in Cognizant really focus on growth so that’s the Mantra for all of us in Cognizant
                                            and that’s perfectly aligned with<br /><br /><br /><br /> me. I always look at how do we grow our business
                                            so that’s aligned that is number one. Number two I like having lot of empowerment
                                            so I never feel like I am working for somebody. So I think I got that from day one,
                                            for last 13 years I would say even whatever designation I was, whatever role I was
                                            playing I always took the complete ownership. I like that, that empowerment. So
                                            in short growth and empowerment. Those are the two keeping me in Cognizant.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            I heard you referred one minute goal. What is that?<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Yeah. I am very passionate about one minute goal and most of my team members would
                                            know. I probably want to show this screen to you. What I feel we all need to focus
                                            being services industry. We need to balance our effort into 2 sides, as two sides
                                            of the coin as you would see. One is customer side, customer perceptive, the second
                                            is Cognizant perceptive. On the customer side, I want to deliver and I want our
                                            team to deliver what the customer really wants. What that really wants is not what
                                            the customer is asking ask to do. What the customer really want to achieve the outcome. So I want all of us to own the outcome and deliver to the outcome. You do

                                            that over and over again what the  customer look for is, what you bring is something different.
                                            So you need to add value, the value is something which is not expected or not realized
                                            by the customer on day one so that’s the value. So those are the two make us grow
                                            in the customer organization that’s all in customer side. But we are not independent
                                            contractors, we are part of a very large organization, award winning, Analytics
                                            and Information Management part of that group.<br />
                                            <br /> So we have to contribute a lot of
                                            things to Cognizant in terms of creating case studies, in terms of providing training,
                                            in terms of attending trainings, utilizing all assets like Platinum, BigDecisions,
                                            BigFrame and all those stuffs. So I want all our team members to be really cognizant
                                            of knowing everything from Cognizant and utilizing that and that is good for Cognizant.
                                            So if you ask whats in it for me as an individual for each of you is groom, grooming.
                                            Right it doesn’t matter it’s a 10 years’ experience, 15 years’ experience you become
                                            a project manager or a program manager. There are some skills which we need to gain.
                                            let it be leadership or communication or effectiveness or technology whatever right.
                                            We need to get ready so that’s I classify as self-grooming ourselves.<br />
                                            <br /> So these are
                                            all what I would call as simple goal for everybody to understand as long as you
                                            own the outcome and you equip yourself for that and we all be successful. That’s
                                            my one minute goal. I know when I explain it may take few more minutes but you can
                                            understand within a minute.<br />
                                            <br /><br />
                                            <br />
                                            Any message for your team?<br />
                                            <br />
                                            No. Not really a message. I don’t think. I am that senior to give a message to the
                                            team. May be I can share, what are some of the principles in which I go with, I
                                            run my life right. Number one whether it is work or personal I always try to follow
                                            one thing. Make others happy if not at least comfortable. So thats a simple message
                                            but it has lot to do it right? So if someone would come and ask you some advice
                                            or someone come and ask you to do some work or may be something some it could be
                                            financial, it could be your work, it could be some effort which I need to put. So
                                            end of the day, I always look for am I making the other person happy 99% I want
                                            to do that. <br />
                                            <br />In few side, you can’t make everybody happy there are situations you
                                            cannot, but I don’t want to upset to I will always put my effort to make that person
                                            comfortable that why am doing this kind of stuff. So that’s my first principle,
                                            make others happy if not at least comfortable. So that is my principle I live in
                                            across the board that is at a broader level, then what I follow in few tips. May
                                            everybody could follow is Work is work Personal is personal and as I said I don’t
                                            work for anybody it’s my role to play I own the outcome.<br />
                                            <br /> So lot of people ask me,
                                            hey why are you working late hours? How do you always work? I always tell them I
                                            don’t work but is there a time I take rest. Yes, from Friday evening 6.00 PM to
                                            Saturday noon I don’t want to receive calls I don’t want to respond to my emails
                                            unless extreme exception cases I generally try to follow that, Friday I always call
                                            it’s a movie night.

                                            Is one thing it makes me relax after five days of long work. I kind of take that,
                                            12 to 18 hours break that really energize me. That’s number one. Number two, I hate
                                            to have lots of mails in my inbox even whether it is unread or read mails so my
                                            target is I don’t want to have more than 25 emails. It may sound funny right.<br />
                                            <br /> Every
                                            day we receive 200, 300 emails if I travel in a week some time it goes to 500 emails.
                                            Either Friday or Saturday between Saturday and Sunday I spend my time to act on
                                            all the emails, archive whatever emails for later thing or delete whatever is not
                                            required and no more than 25 emails. That makes me feel that my plate is not full
                                            and I am ready for more. So I can respond to emails as quickly as possible. Those
                                            are all few tips what I follow and make me happy and I go by that.

                                            a lot of non linear revenue through our Insurance platforms that we will create
                                            or Analytic centered solution that we will create. And more importantly we want
                                            to bring in a very strong eco-system of partners, CDO’s and also may be some CXO’s.
                                            So we are working with some of the large Insurance companies already. We’ve heard
                                            some very very niche innovations in play. We also have some very strong partnership
                                            eco-system that we are signing with one after the other and its all starting to
                                            work for us.<br />
                                            <br /><br />
                                            <br />
                                            So Big Decisions is core for our platform strategy. We have some fairly young team
                                            members joining our team, we have very seasoned industry exports coming into our
                                            team and at the end of the day we want this to bloom into a very large Practice
                                            for us. So our vision and that’s the most important part of what we are doing, our vision
                                            is actually to make Cognizant one of the top intermediaries infomediaries in 2020
                                            for the Insurance industry - right. And not just in North America, we want to drive
                                            that growth into rest of the world as well. So it’s a fairly global, very inspiring
                                            vision that we have and we will be working very hard at it. What we need from you is support an IGS and also direct involvement in making ,
                                            you know, this vision into reality. So I welcome you into AIM once again and I hope
                                            you have a great time working with us and if you want to really know what we are

                                            I would like to also talk briefly about some personal things that I often enjoy.
                                            So for many years I’ve been enjoying various activities, specifically in the area
                                            of long distance running. I’ve competed in 5Ks, 10Ks and marathons and I really
                                            enjoyed that sport. And in recent years I’ve really started to pick up yoga and
                                            swimming as a predominant sport as well. So I’ve really, this is something that
                                            I personally enjoy.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            I hope to meet with some of you, in the coming months and I hope that you enjoy
                                            this video. Thank you.

                                            Hey what’s up guys? This is Sriram here. this is our new family member bilbodogins,
                                            10 weeks old golden retriever, we all love him and he has already become big and
                                            is going to grow really big like our AIM. I will let him go.<br />

                                            We had a great 2015 and looking forward to an amazing 2016, I have three key messages
                                            for all of us.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Today digital is at the front end center of anything and everything. Karthik in
                                            his blog has written it, he has spoken about it several times, Frank has spoken
                                            about it several times. In my 20+ years of career, I have never seen a revolution
                                            like this before. There is a huge demand and curiosity about cyber security digital
                                            and cloud. Acquiring more capabilities in these areas will give each one of you
                                            more confidence to succeed. Please take Analytics, Big Data, Data science or even
                                            elevated level statistics course, because that is what leaders like us want to see.

                                            My second message. There is a stress in high performing careers like ours, particularly
                                            in today’s highly competitive world. If you are not careful that stress can penetrate
                                            our bodies to the bones. There is an interesting quote by James Patterson I would
                                            like to<br />
                                            <br /><br />
                                            <br /> share with you. Imagine life is a game in which you are juggling five balls,
                                            the balls are called work, family, health, friends and integrity and you are keeping
                                            all of them in the air. But one day you finally come to understand that work is
                                            rubber ball if you drop it, it will bounce back and the other four balls are made
                                            of glass. If you drop one of this, it will be irrevocably scuffed perhaps even shattered.
                                            Always keep that in mind and find time to eat well, exercise well and get good sleep,
                                            spend more time with your family.<br />

                                            My third message. Each one of you is a star player. We need to create star teams
                                            out of this star players, together we will achieve great heights in 2016. I would
                                            like to give you one example. You may be knowing Kyle Busch. Kyle Busch 6 member
                                            team in NASCAR circle is considered to be one of the best. The crew members tried
                                            together year round with one clear goal in mind, to get Busch in and out of the
                                            pit in the shortest possible time. That crew can execute a standard pit stop including
                                            refueling and a change of all four tires in just 12.12 second.12.12 seconds, what
                                            can we do right, but they will change all four tires, refuel it and send him out
                                            of the pit as soon as possible. So that is possible because they all work together and achieve because each

                                            Hi, this is Prasad Subramani. By way of a quick introduction, I co-lead Life Sciences
                                            Business Solutions Group. I work out of Bridgewater New Jersey office and I live
                                            close to Philly. I’m married. My wife teaches and does research at Rutgers. She
                                            is a geneticist. I have two kids, a 10 year old boy and a 6 year old girl.
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            In my free time, its mostly spent with the family or reading books and whatever
                                            time is left I spend it on recreational Mathematics. That’s one of my private passion
                                            or a personal passion area and there are lots of interesting things which start
                                            out as recreational Math but it has larger implications and I am constantly trying
                                            to find all those connections.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            About my professional career, spent about 16 years in the US, primarily working
                                            for a Strategy Consulting Company and then I moved on to a very small Analytics
                                            venture which was then acquired by Cognizant. I’ve been doing primarily Life Sciences
                                            work and for a short while Healthcare and also Manufacturing and I’ve spent a lot
                                            of time in the pipeline end of the business and then the last 10 years in the commercialization
                                            end of the Pharma business.<br /><br />
                                            It’s a very exciting time to be in Pharma right now. There are some transformative
                                            things which are happening. Last 15 or 20 years people have been primarily talking
                                            about physicians and what to do with physicians but right now there is a clearer
                                            and broader definition emerging about who our customer is and these are all very
                                            good indicators of the opening up which is going to happen in this space in Life
                                            Sciences space.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            If you go back 30 or 40years, that is, like if you go talk to your dad and mom,
                                            30-40years back a doctor would compound a medication for a patient’s specific disease
                                            and surprisingly that’s the direction we are going in, into the future. In the next
                                            5 to 10 years, if you have a disease, there is a very high probability that the
                                            doctor or the system is going to custom design something for you. What this means
                                            is, there is going to be this tremendous appreciation for Data Analytics and managing
                                            information and then providing the right kind of support infrastructure around what
                                            a patient requires and who ever is going to understand this space of data is going
                                            to be the master of the universe and the Life Sciences and Healthcare space and
                                            its going

                                            Hi I am Steve Kernan. I am one of the co-leaders of the AIM Life Sciences Business

                                            When I come home from work and on weekends, I like to build guitars here at my workshop.
                                            And the reason I do is, its hard after the long day where we work hard on our customers’
                                            problems to see an outcome. It can take so long and for me being able to build something
                                            in a short period of time, being able to see the fruit of my labor means a lot.
                                            What is also interesting is that, we can start with something so simple, as pieces
                                            of wood and we can take it to different levels of complexity, more complexity. Where
                                            we end up with something beautifully complex, I can do so many things.

                                            As I look at what we try to do with our customers is the exact opposite of what
                                            I do here in my workshop. In my workshop, I take something simple and make it complex.
                                            For customers, I think what they want from us is how do we take their complex problems
                                            and make them simple.

                                            to take their very complex world and make it simple is the key to the success for
                                            us, the key to the success for our clients.

                                            getting to build things. But also getting to build things in a professional world,
                                            working with great individuals, solve the complex business problems is a great deal

                                            Hello my name is in Ian West. I am the head of the Analytics and Information management
                                            in the UK and Ireland. Today I want to talk to you about one of my favorite past
                                            time which is Rugby. A game that I have played since my early teenage and something
                                            that I am very very passionate about.
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            And Rugby like many of the international sport and play around the world was born
                                            into the British private school system in the mid 19th century. Australian rules
                                            football was originally Gaelic football plus American football. Rugby is invented
                                            in the school nearby where I live. There is a huge camaraderie in the game of Rugby
                                            that's within team and between team and thats a great part what we do in working
                                            lives. You are completely reliant on the 14 members of the team and individual moments
                                            of brilliance do happen, it is absolutely team's score. You win together, you lose
                                            together. For me its a great metaphor. Rugby is my passion at weekends and Analytics
                                            and Information management is my passion during the week. Thanks so much everybody.

                                            Good evening everyone, my name is Aurelio, Aurelio D’inverno. I lead the Analytics
                                            and Information Management practice since 2011 when I joined Cognizant. I basically
                                            built the practice almost from scratch and we have established presence in over
                                            major geographies in Continental Europe.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            What have we done in 2015, so first of all from a target achievement perspective
                                            we are very close baring some exchange rate effects which affect all of us, so despite
                                            that we have achieved the growth rate of about 23% which I believe is significant
                                            given the exchange rate impact. We have successfully integrated EDM as a service
                                            line. We are preparing to integrate Cognizant Analytics. So we have done the planning
                                            together setting up the target, define the target accounts, so on and so forth.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            We have achieved some major wins in significant accounts. Here are some example.
                                            So RaboBank, I think we have managed to secure a delivery of solution based on Microsoft
                                            Azure, Cortana Analytics which by the way has got great publicity within Microsoft
                                            itself. Philips – 2 major things to mention here. First very successful implementation
                                            of Master Data Management product and Second very<br />
                                            <br /> large footprint of Cognizant Analytics
                                            helped Philips basically do sentiment analytics and other things. Novartis – major
                                            win mostly driven by the US but still I think we have contributed significantly
                                            from the CE perspective. UBS, small win, but we are getting there, getting positions
                                            that UBS want to push to us but consolidating local consultants. Telesonera, we
                                            entered this account through CBC led engagement and will be looking at architectures,
                                            big data architecture and so on. Lufthansa again significant win from a big data
                                            perspective, analytics perspective. We have had an excellent relationship with ISS.
                                            I think we are going to push for, lets say show them a POC for smart buildings,
                                            concepts on temperature, electricity consumption and many more.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            So the other thing I want to mention is we have achieved a significant traction
                                            from a partnership perspective. First one I want to mention is Informatica, because
                                            we have won 3 global awards mostly because of Europe – Master Data Management, Big
                                            Data and Best Partner of the year. Microsoft – we are betting quite lot on Microsoft and basically going to market
                                            together for our BigDecisions platform, that we are porting to their stack. We are
                                            managing also the Qlik <br /><br /><br />

                                            relationship from a global perspective. So we expect to generate
                                            a lot of traction through the partnership in 2016.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            I think we are bunch of proud people to contribute to Cognizant from a thought leadership
                                            perspective, solutioning. We typically better than competition when we put forward
                                            our solutions and clients recognize that. We manage to limit the number of escalations
                                            that happens basically as soon as there is an escalation, we jump and try to address
                                            it and all of this obviously we have done it with great people. Just wanted to thank
                                            some of the people that have contributed to this. First of all is Torsten from Germany,
                                            then we have Gwellyn from Benelux, Anoop based in Denmark, Neelima based in Sweden
                                            although she joined in May last year she is pushing pretty hard for a SEB opportunity,
                                            Jean Martin Lopez in France, he is also leading EDM which is very successful last
                                            year and Ralph from Switzerland – significant contribution for the win and Arcene
                                            have been obviously pushing hard for the partnership and may others, I cannot name
                                            everybody here. Ok. So thanks you again for your support and obviously looking forward
                                            to work with you next year. Bye.

                                            I get time in chennai, I go to the beaches, parks like this for long walk. Specifically
                                            on weekends, I like this outdoor activity that keeps me enough fit.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            More than this I am very passionate about data and analytics. I believe that data
                                            and analytics are primarily driving the digital transformation journey. Most of
                                            our customers are embarking on that journey to transform their business using digital
                                            technologies and we at AIM Cognizant are very well positioned to help our customers
                                            in that journey. I invite all of you to be part of that journey and also the long
                                            walks I take if you like. Thank you.
                                        </p>

                                            I am Sivakumar Thandavamoorthy. I am with Cognizant for close to 10 years. I'm part
                                            of AIM family delivering projects for banking customers.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            I strongly believe in Best-in-class delivery will yield healthy business. So I would
                                            like each and every individual be focused on delivering projects right at first
                                            time with good quality. To achieve this we need to have a focused thinking process
                                            in place before we deliver solution irrespective of waterfall model or iterative
                                            model or agile model. This will help us to reduce rework and to deliver an optimal
                                            solution. With this note I am proud to be with you all in AIM family. Will catch
                                            you soon. Bye.

                                            Hi everyone, warm welcome. I am extremely happy to be part of the Cognizant AIM
                                            family and very excited about it too.</p>
                                        <br />
                                        <p class="chapter-text">
                                            As you all know, we are in the cusp of a very big transformation in business today
                                            as technology and digital initiatives become mainstream and not the support function
                                            that it used to be earlier. Something that Cognizant is at the forefront of. And
                                            as Clients look at Cognizant to be a business partner rather than a pure IT vendor,
                                            AIM is very well positioned to play that role because we can now combine domain
                                            and analytics knowledge with deep data and information management expertise to deliver
                                            business solutions to clients.</p>
                                        <br />
                                        <p class="chapter-text">
                                            I am excited because Cognizant is one of fastest growing companies in the world today, a company that everyone else wants to emulate. Within Cognizant, AIM is one of the best horizontals to be in. We won the best horizontal award in 2015, and for those of us in BFS, we are the largest and one of the fastest growing groups within AIM. So if you look at it that way, we will actually be riding from the highest point on the largest wave. And that will only be exhilarating right!</p>

                                            As Sheryl Sandberg puts it very well in one of her recent books ‘If someone offers

                                            similar. Its going to be one hell of a ride guys. Good Luck!.

                                            Let me share with you something interesting I came about. Can you see a picture
                                            that has 2 tables [refers a picture in the video]. Now can you guess which one is
                                            shorter and which one is longer. Take a hard look. Yeah I think you would have guessed,
                                            most people would have guessed that the left table is longer and thinner and the
                                            right one is wider right. That is what I also thought like 90% of the people but
                                            actually both are of the same size. This is an interesting idea or concept on how
                                            our brains work, how it behaves and how visual cues lead us to different decisions.
                                            This I came across when I read a book called ‘Nudge’, some of you would have read
                                            this.
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            I like reading, helps me get introduced to new ideas, concepts and what people do
                                            like interesting stuff. I get these books and other unique materials offline and
                                            online by references, recommendations from friends, colleagues, teams and smart
                                            people like you. And I read different topics, they all seem to be unrelated when
                                            I go through, but later point in time they all get connected when you are working
                                            on a different problem. That’s the interesting Aha moment right, you <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />get exposed
                                            to different ideas, what people are doing. It also gives a strong positive feeling,
                                            sense of abundance right. So that’s why I like reading.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            I feel lucky to be working with AIM. There are lot of smart people like you always
                                            doing some interesting stuff, coming up with new ideas and also refer points to
                                            interesting stuff. I am sure you must be working on something interesting, new idea,
                                            new experiment or you would have read something interesting creative. Let me know.
                                            I am curious to know, maybe we can share these new concepts with others right and
                                            it can lead to new possibilities.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            So before I sign off let me share a quick puzzle with you. Puzzle is: can you guess
                                            the next number in the series - 2 4 6 ?. Keep guessing and let me know. I will give
                                            you a clue. There is no one single answer for this. Okay, Bye, we will connect later.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

                                            Hello Folks, My name is Karthik Swaminathan, an old timer of Cognizant. I’m currently
                                            playing the role of CIO for AIM. From Academic standpoint, I did Bachelor of Science
                                            in Physics and Master of Computer Applications. I started my career as a developer
                                            and I was good at C programming language. In fact, I developed my own editor called
                                            PED, which is Program Editor and I also had my own virus scanner and it was called
                                            as ‘Flu’. Peter Norton was my role model and I was a certified C developer
                                            as well.<br /><br />
                                            Then came the era of PowerBuilder. Again, I was a certified PowerBuilder developer
                                            during those days. That’s when I joined with Cognizant’s Media vertical, I still
                                            carry my certification credentials even though it’s not valid at this point of time.
                                            By 2003, I moved from Cognizant’s Media vertical to AIM. Data Quality is one of
                                            my favorite subject area. Again, I’m a certified data quality professional now.
                                            I think, the certification is valid till the end of 2017. Getting certification
                                            really boosts your confidence level on what you are doing. The certification I have
                                            made me to design, architect and implement our proprietary data quality solution
                                            called Enterprise Data Clarity or simply EDC. You can go through my blogs for getting
                                            some interesting facts<br /><br /> about data quality.
                                            <br /><br />
                                            I also worked on program managing ANN which is AIM News Network; HERO enabled version
                                            of Risk Analytics Engine; and finally BIDS which is our BD portal. My goal is to
                                            rank each one in our practice based on your contributions towards Delivery for wihch
                                            I’m planning to use HERO enabled version of Risk Analytics Engine. And then based
                                            on your contributions towards Business Development, if it is applicable. For this
                                            I’m planning to use BIDS. And then based on your contributions towards practice
                                            level initiatives like ANN. You can logon to ANN, then select Quick Reference from
                                            there and then select “View Detailed Summary” to see your rank.

                                            On a lighter side, when it comes to music, I’m a big fan of Illayaraja. And my daughter
                                            and wife have misconception that I like illayaraj’s songs more than them! When it
                                            comes to Automobiles, especially on Cars, I like Aston Martin DB10, Ghost and Phantom.
                                            ….and that’s it. If you have any questions or comments, you can always reach out

                                                “You Need Power, only when you want do something harmful. Otherwise love is enough
                                                to get everything done.” – Charlie Chaplin “Being honest may not get you many friends.
                                                But It’ll always get you the right ones.”</br> “Work for Cause, Not for Applause.
                                                Live life to express not Impress. Don’t Strive to make your presence noticed, just
                                                make your absence felt.”

                                            Hi everyone, this is Srini. I am part of Cognizant AIM family for last 13+ years.
                                            I’ve played various roles across various different industry verticals within AIM
                                            and I am passion about taking up challenges and then finding solutions that are
                                            best for both our customers and Cognizant.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            It has been an exciting journey for all this years. I love taking up challenges
                                            and as you see our Analytics landscape as such is going through the same, which
                                            is providing us lot of opportunities in terms of new Technologies and Business avenues
                                            to find solutions.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            In terms of my personal hobbies, I like to collect different sounds and I’ve been
                                            collecting LB records and audio cassette, CDs and other types of sound for last
                                            5 – 6 years. It has been a great journey for me. I love my daughter and I spend
                                            lot of time with my family, both daughter and wife, and lately both me and daughter
                                            are going through horse riding courses for last 1 and half year. Thanks.

                                            Hi everyone. I am passionate about cricket, I do play cricket, watch cricket. Nowadays
                                            I watch more than I play. So today I am busy with the India vs Australia final one
                                            day international which is being played at Sydney. I think its an interesting game.
                                            It looks like India is going to win. We have had few losses in the past but hopefully
                                            we should be able to recover today.

                                            to the AIM organization. This organization is a very very interesting organization
                                            which believes in team work, client success and it’s a fun filled environment. I
                                            think the philosophy is all around ‘Work hard, Play hard’ and I think this is something
                                            that is unique about this organization compared to the rest of the organization
                                            within the company.

                                            of things are changing, new technologies are coming. I think the technologies are
                                            changing very rapidly especially in this space. I think lot of learning is something
                                            that will keep everyone motivated because all this new learning is always good.
                                            So that’s my view about how analytics is going to plan out in the future. So thanks

                                            Hello friends, I am Vinod, with Cognizant for 12 years, responsible for offshore
                                            CommTech Delivery. It gives me a great pleasure and welcoming you all to the AIM
                                            Practice. Outside of work I like spending time with my daughters and wife playing,
                                            learning and just being with them.<br />

                                            Looking at the global economic conditions every single company today requires a
                                            very high focus on Data and Analytics to help them survive. Customers and their
                                            businesses need real time, low cost, Big Data solutions that can provide automated
                                            insight. This to me is a big challenge for all of us to deliver on this transformational
                                            need and we in AIM family need to quickly be in a position to learn, adopt and deliver
                                            on these expectations. This will really help us to become the company of choice
                                            for Analytics and Information Management globally. Happy learning.

                                            Hi, I am Sriram Vembu, the SBU leader of AIM IME business segment. I have been associated

                                            During my tenure in Cognizant AIM family, I have been peppered with entertainment,
                                            enthusiasm, excitement, opportunities, key learnings. I have regard with enormous
                                            pleasure, being part of defining moments of the AIM family both professionally and
                                            personally. Our leaders believed in empowering every single AIM associates to be
                                            achievers, venture out and make a mark. Today I would like to extend the same positivity,

                                                            heart. Listening to music, gardening are my pastime.

                                            Hi, I am Usha Rengarajan. I’ve been with Cognizant for over 19 years and in AIM
                                            since inception. It has been an exciting journey for me since the Data Warehousing
                                            COE days and I’ve had the opportunity to work in multiple roles across various domains
                                            in this Practice. Currently I head AIM Healthcare and AIM AVM.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Healthcare is very close to my heart because my childhood dream was to become a
                                            doctor. Hence I would consider it fortunate to be in Healthcare IT during these
                                            exciting times. With more focus on Healthcare in this digital era, I think we have
                                            lot of challenging problems to solve together.
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            Outside of healthcare, organic farming or gardening is my passion. I grow lot of
                                            medicinal herbs and vegetables at home and infact I use these medicinal herbs to
                                            treat some of the common ailments.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            So I want to do more and I think automation is going to be the key to do more with
                                            the same amount of resources, be it farming or healthcare. So do share me your thoughts
                                            on any of these subjects and I would be happy to hear or discuss with you all. Wishing
                                            you a successful 2016. Thank you.

                                            Hi, I am Sriram Nukala. I lead the Business Solutions group within AIM Insurance

                                            we are gearing ourselves up, to develop various digital solutions and related platforms
                                            to solve some of our customers’ most challenging problems.<br />
                                            <br />

                                            and grow along this journey to 20-20. So lets all join our hands and collectively

                                            Soumen, last five years EDM has done a fabulous job with 25% CAGAR and 2015 been
                                            a great year for all of us. So how do you see 2016 is there in store for EDM and
                                            beyond?<br />
                                            <br />
                                            All right sure, I think lets discuss about what we want to do next right? So what
                                            we need to do is definitely set up a new vision for our self. I don’t see 2016 in
                                            isolation, we need to align our self with our 2020 vision. So if I had to define
                                            a new vision for us, EDM to provide a world class services to our global clients
                                            which will help adopt digital technology, drive process automation , help them in
                                            consumerization journey at the advent of this digital age. Our innovation led technology
                                            and services to help our new age state source to embrace the new disruptive technology
                                            that would be competitive in nature for them. And that would include structured
                                            /unstructured data, data production upkeep, data management, data monetization avenues
                                            to gain market competitiveness. This is how I wish to define our new vision.<br />
                                            <br /> So
                                            moving forward guys, mission of cognizant 2020 is to lead the market place  <br />
                                            <br /><br />
                                            <br />by envisioning
                                            and building a digital economy. We must go beyond the CIO organization and build
                                            relationship with CxOs - CMOs, CFOs, Chief of R&D and the entire C suite and create
                                            a differentiation for our self with the business insights, technical platforms for
                                            continued business and provide a thought leadership as a leading age service partner.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            Next gen solutions are going to be very important. So the process automation or
                                            digital solutions or cognitive software platform these are going to be very very
                                            important and we need to dig it into our plan for 2016 and beyond. Innovations and
                                            transformations are of course very important like IP infusion, advance technology
                                            labs, delivery transformation, and use of automation and of course the BIC and the
                                            Kisernat scale. So we are going to dig it in our plan moving forward.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            So my next question will be on the people front, so how do you see the new organization
                                            structure for us, for cognizant, would kind of attract new millennial to this space
                                            and also retain our top talents?<br />
                                            <br />
                                             There is definitely a competition in the

                                            ground to acquire top talents from the
                                            market. Obviously that’s not the path always beneficial for us. So we need to create talents
                                            as well internally. <br />
                                            <br />And guys, new organizational forms are coming to the picture.
                                            Straight Monday to Friday 9 to 6 kind of job is no longer attractive for younger
                                            generation. If you think about business models, there are new forms of business
                                            models evolving, think about Uber right, any disruptive or new startups that you
                                            see in the market. What is going to be important is both internal and external partnership
                                            is very important, so employees are important but crowd sourcing will be equally
                                            important. <br />
                                            <br />Just think about Procter & Gamble, all long they have been doing innovations
                                            like inside out, but now what they are doing is they are paying lot of attention
                                            on crowd sourcing and connect and develop approach. So maybe we can think something
                                            out of the box all together on this front.

                                            Yeah I’m Arun VS, I lead the AIM Practice for ANZ and here with me here is Ken Oatey
                                            who is the founder and managing director for BATL which is an Analytics company
                                            in local Australian New Zealand region and we are partnering here to basically take
                                            Analytics as an insight service to clients like Kohl’s, Woolworths mainly retailers
                                            and how Analytics can help in improving their performance in stores.<br />
                                            <br />
                                            And you can see on here, we have a solution which basically talks about the number
                                            of visitors a store has had, kind of sales they have got, the opportunities in different
                                            stores, the kind of retail potential we have, the dwell time in terms of waiting
                                            time and this can be used not just for retailers, this can also be used for Restaurants,
                                            McDonalds, chain of restaurants to basically determine what’s the wait time of a
                                            customer, what’s the optimal time that we can actually reduce the wait time, how
                                            we can actually manage the supply demand into the customer, improve the quality
                                            of service and we also have on the left and right a few camera based technology
                                            for analytics which basically stores the demographics of a person – male/female,
                                            age, what kind of emotions they represent and so on. And this<br />
                                            <br /> <br />
                                            <br /><br />
                                            <br />is something which
                                            we have been discussing for sometime with customers like Woolworths and there is
                                            an interest to basically do a quick POC and go forward.
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            And here Ken do you want to add something.<br />
                                            <br />

                                            Yeah, so effectively we capture data using two types of technologies. We’ve got
                                            the NEC product which is fundamentally camera and software that basically captures
                                            the age and gender so you can see one of the staff as he has walked in. He’s been
                                            followed up. He’s been captured –around 27 year old male and has been populated
                                            as a high level graph.
                                            <br />
                                            <br />
                                            On the other side we use brickstream technology which is basically the most accurate
                                            people counting and that technology follows a person and hands off to another location
                                            , so nobody gets counted double, in terms of their customers experience in the local
                                            shopping center. This end captures all those two together and consolidates up into a manageable dashboard
                                            that, when you integrate the point of sale and capture that, you get a standard physical Analytics at

                                            Now this is where I think we can do great stuff, because we spend time with a physical
                                            locations, Cognizant spends time at the virtual locations, the data warehousing
                                            data, the ERP data, pulling that together and giving a customer a long short to
                                            medium term insights on where these things are going.

                                            I think the potential partnership we will be looking here is to host us on BigDecisions
                                            Platform and take it as a digital solution to our clients, in terms of one insight
                                            as a service. Second obviously use data integration accelerators like Platinum,
                                            to bring in the data and Third is obviously you know use some of our solutions on
                                            the digital side to alert the customers through mobile or other devices in terms
                                            of the potential opportunities and actionable insights that we can take it. Thanks.

                                        The AIM Chronicles are a fun and creative way for our thousands of associates within
                                        AIM globally to get to know about their leaders. This AIM Chronicles booklet gives
                                        more personalized view into each leader in AIM. The AIM Chronicles are an opportunity
                                        for the global teams to get to know their leaders better, a platform to make associates
                                        feel comfortable in approaching their leader and a way for the leader to immediately
                                        connect with their teams virtually. Associates can view a short video of each leader
                                        telling more about themselves and can also see the leadership message from AIM Practice
                                        Heads covering guiding principles of AIM.
